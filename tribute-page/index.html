          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi was a
          major political and spiritual leader of India who led the country in
          the non-cooperation movement in 1922 and Salt march in 1930 and later
          in Quit India movement in 1942 during its struggle for independence.
          Known as Beloved Baapu in India, Mahatma Gandhi adopted the policy of
          mass disobedience and non-violent resistance as weapons against the
          British Rule in India and followed a principle of Ahimsa (total
          Non-Violence). He endured several hardships, was arrested and
          occasionally beaten in his journey and struggle to Justice and
          Freedom. However, his struggle does not restrict to India itself, as
          the leader played a key role in the Civil Rights movement in South
          Africa and secured them the right to justice and equality.
